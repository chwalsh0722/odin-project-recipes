                    <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>

                    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>

                    <li>4 cups mozzarella cheese</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Heat olive oil in 
                        skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook for 
                        about 3 - 4 minutes. Add ground beef and increase 
                        heat to medium-high. Cook until the meat begins 
                        to brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with garlic 
                        powder, salt, and pepper.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lower heat to low and add marinara sauce. If you 
                        want the lasagna to be extra saucy, I suggest adding 
                        more sauce. Let the sauce continue to simmer.

        <h4>Parmesan Ricotta Cheese Filling:</h4>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small bowl, stir together ricotta cheese, 
                        parmesan cheese, egg, basil, salt, and pepper.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cook lasagna noodles according to package 
                        instructions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spread the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking pan with 
                        1/4 cup of the meat sauce. Place 3 noodles in a 
                        single layer on top of the sauce. Spread each 
                        noodle with parmesan ricotta cheese filling and 
                        sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and meta 
                        sauce. Repeat. Finish with remaining mozzarella cheese.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spray a large piece of foil with non-stick cooking 
                        spray and cover the lasagna. Bake for 15 minutes and 
                        then removes the foil. Continue to bake until the 
                        cheese is bubbling, about 25 minutes longer. Cool the 
                        lasagna for 10 minutes before cutting into pieces.
